# <a name="JS"> Javascript
## Install (for js)
```
npm install eslint --save-dev
```
## setup config  (package.json should already be available!)
```
npx eslint --init
```
There will be a .eslintrc.{js,yml,json} file in your directory after you followed the two installation steps

You will already find some rules specified like this:
```
{
    "rules": {
        "semi": ["error", "always"],
        "quotes": ["error", "double"]
    }
}
```

The names "semi" and "quotes" are the names of rules in ESLint. The first value is the error level of the rule and can be one of these values:
- "off" or 0 - turn the rule off
- "warn" or 1 - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn't affect exit code)
- "error" or 2 - turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1)

for the 2nd parameter (i.e. always) checkout [click](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/)

## Default configuration

Your .eslintrc.{js,yml,json} configuration file will also include the line:

```
{
    "extends": "eslint:recommended"
}
```
    
Because of this line, all of the rules marked "âœ“" on the rules page will be turned on. Alternatively, you can use configurations that others have created by searching for "eslint-config" on [npmjs.com](npmjs.com). ESLint will not lint your code unless you extend from a shared configuration or explicitly turn rules on in your configuration.

# <a name="TS"></a>Typescript
## Install 
```
npm install --save-dev eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```
## setup config  (package.json should already be available!)
```
npx touch .eslintrc.json
```

Insert this default config into the file
```
{
  "root": true,
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "plugins": [
    "@typescript-eslint"
  ],
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
  ]
} 
```

## Error: "Failed to load th TSLint Library..."
Install tslint again in repo and reopen, happened in VS Code

## Error: Not using the local TSLint version...
"Not using the local TSLint version found for 'c:/Users/manue/Documents/GitHub/CAS_FE_Project2_learnWithIndexCards/LearnWithIndexCards/src/app/app.component.ts'
To enable code execution from the current workspace you must enable workspace library execution.tslint(1)"

As decribed on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65228384/tslint-extension-throwing-errors-in-my-angular-application-running-in-visual-stu) you have to do the following steps:

1. In VS Code hit Ctrl + shift + P
2. Enter TSLint: Manage workspace library execution" in the popup + Enter
3. Select submenu "enable workspace library execution" and hit Enter

You should at least have a different Error (or it might work...)

# Error: Cannot read tslint configuration...
"Cannot read tslint configuration - 'Failed to load c:\Users\manue\Documents\GitHub\CAS_FE_Project2_learnWithIndexCards\LearnWithIndexCards\tslint.json: Could not find custom rule directory: node_modules/codelyzer'tslint(1)"

You might have missed the step:
```
npx eslint --init
```

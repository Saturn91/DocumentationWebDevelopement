# Eslint setupt

[source](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)

## Steps
1.install
```
npm install eslint --save-dev
```
2. setup configuration file (package.json should already be available!)
```
npx eslint --init
```

## Configuration
There will be a .eslintrc.{js,yml,json} file in your directory after you followed the two installation steps

You will already find some rules specified like this:
```
{
    "rules": {
        "semi": ["error", "always"],
        "quotes": ["error", "double"]
    }
}
```

The names "semi" and "quotes" are the names of rules in ESLint. The first value is the error level of the rule and can be one of these values:
- "off" or 0 - turn the rule off
- "warn" or 1 - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn't affect exit code)
- "error" or 2 - turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1)

for the 2nd parameter (i.e. always) checkout [click](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/)

### Default configuration

Your .eslintrc.{js,yml,json} configuration file will also include the line:

```
{
    "extends": "eslint:recommended"
}
```

Because of this line, all of the rules marked "âœ“" on the rules page will be turned on. Alternatively, you can use configurations that others have created by searching for "eslint-config" on [npmjs.com](npmjs.com). ESLint will not lint your code unless you extend from a shared configuration or explicitly turn rules on in your configuration.

# Usability testing

Frontend is a conversation

## Goals
- understand Users
- You know the basics
- prepare Usability Tests and execute them

## User research
- Websites should have (a) target(s) group
- Try to figure out which journey / flow users experience in or with your product
  - can be spilt in events
    - which result in components, interactions and emotions 

This journey can be split into, learn, inspire, decide, enjoy, tell others, (grow -> direct effect but not done by the user)
